# My Cluster Creation Fails Due To an Issue With Custom DNS Setup

## Issue
You have set up a custom DNS for your cluster, and you encounter a failure with:
* ErrorCode "FailedToConnectWithClusterErrorCode"
* ErrorDescription: "Unable to connect to cluster management endpoint. Please retry later."

## Resolution
Follow the steps below to validate that your custom DNS is set up properly.

### Validate that 168.63.129.16 is in the custom DNS chain
DNS servers within a virtual network can forward DNS queries to Azure's recursive resolvers to resolve hostnames within that virtual network. Access to Azure's recursive resolvers is provided via the virtual IP 168.63.129.16.

ssh into the cluster head node, and run the below command:

`sshuser@hostname:~$ cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver*`

You should see something like this:

`nameserver 168.63.129.16`

`nameserver 10.21.34.43`

`nameserver 10.21.34.44`

If 168.63.129.16 is not the first server in this list, then there are 2 options to fix this issue:

1. Add this as the first custom dns for the vNet using the steps described in [Azure HDInsight Virtual Network documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network#example-dns).

1. Deploy a DNS server VM for the vNet. (Create and insert link to instructions here.)

If 168.63.129.16 is already in the list, then please create a support case with HDInsight, and we will investigate your issue. Before creating the case, follow the steps in [Validate HostName resolution for a cluster with Custom DNS](#validate-hostname-resolution-for-a-cluster-with-custom-dns). Including the result of these commands in your support case will help us investigate and resolve the issue quicker.

### Validate HostName resolution for a cluster

Ssh into the cluster head node, and run the below commands. Please include the results of these commands in your support case:

`Hostname -f`

`nslookup <headnode_fqdn>` (e.g.nslookup hn1-hditest.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net)

`dig @168.63.129.16 <headnode_fqdn>` (e.g. dig @168.63.129.16 hn0-hditest.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net). This uses the **Azure Recursive Resolver (IPAddress: 168.63.129.16)** for name resolution. Note the output of this command - it should 0 or 1.
