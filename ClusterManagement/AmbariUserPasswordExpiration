Traditionally, HDInsight base Ubuntu Images did not explicitly set the password expiration of Hadoop accounts. Recent Linux Kernel enforced password expiration after 70 days. However, Hadoop account should not expire. Only user added accounts should have an expiration.


We have corrected the base image and also patched most of customer clusters. We could not patch your cluster as your NSG rule prevented us from connecting with your cluster  


To mitigate the issue manually you need to:

# First reset the admin password in the Azure portal to get headnode access.

# Then run the following commands in a shell windows on all nodes:

## Update passwords of internal accounts

sudo chage -M 99999 mapred

sudo chage -M 99999 hdfs

sudo chage -M 99999 yarn

sudo chage -M 99999 oozie

sudo chage -M 99999 hive

sudo chage -M 99999 ambari-qa

sudo chage -M 99999 zookeeper

sudo chage -M 99999 tez

sudo chage -M 99999 sqoop

sudo chage -M 99999 hcat

sudo chage -M 99999 ams

sudo chage -M 99999 hbase

sudo chage -M 99999 storm

sudo chage -M 99999 kafka

sudo chage -M 99999 spark

sudo chage -M 99999 falcon

sudo chage -M 99999 ranger

sudo chage -M 99999 kms

sudo echo "patching ambari user expiry policy completed." | logger
