
Symptoms 

Any spark application submitted via Spark-Submit would complete the job execution but the **spark-submit would just hang**.

Spark Jobs deployed triggers huge amount of logging events (MdsLogger).

Steps to Reproduce the issue.

*    Create a Spark Cluster 2.2. or 2.3
*    Execute a sample Spark Application
*        spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --class SparkCore_WasbIOTest default_artifact.jar

Find the job executed, finished successfully but the spark-submit would just hand and **will not exit followed by MdsLgger entries**.

Resolution: 
*    Execute following command on hn0 & hn1 to create a soft link, that points to the right jar file. This command would resolve the Spark-Submit hang issue.  But continue with the next step to resolve the high CPU issue. 
```
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/hdinsight-logging/mdsdclient-1.0.jar $SPARK_HOME/jars/mdsdclient-1.jar
```
*    Restart all Spark and related services like Thrift server, Livy etc through Ambari, after the services restart you should not see high CPU utilization.
