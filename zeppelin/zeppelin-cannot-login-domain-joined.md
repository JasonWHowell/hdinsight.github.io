### TSG Zeppelin Cannot Login 
#### Issue
Cannot login to Zeppelin after changing the ADDS password in active directory.

#### Symptoms
- The user mentioned in the ```activeDirectoryRealm.systemUsername``` of the ```shiro_ini``` file changed the active directory password. 
- Only the user mentioned in the shiro file is able to login to zeppelin.
- No other domain joined user can login to zeppelin.


#### Resolution Steps
1.	Verify that the changed password is the root cause by including ```activeDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = <new password>``` in the zeppelin shiro_ini config in ambari. Remove the ```activeDirectoryRealm.hadoopSecurityCredentialPath``` setting. Below is location of shiro ini.

2.	If users can now login to zeppelin after step 1, create a new jceks file with the new password and replace the ```activeDirectoryRealm.hadoopSecurityCredentialPath``` with the new file.
